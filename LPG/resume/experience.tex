\begin{cvparagraph}
I was hired by Cox Automotive, then called Dealer.com, as an
Engineering Manager, one of two in their Manhattan Beach, CA office.
I managed engineers who were part of 2 scrum teams, a total of 7
individuals.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Prior to becoming an Engineering Manager in my career, I had been a
senior software engineer, and after becoming an Engineering Manager, I kept my
hands in the code, usually by intercepting one-off requests that
risked derailing my team's planned efforts.\@ In late 2016, Cox
Automotive decided to end it's engineering presence in the Manhattan
Beach office.\@ At that point, I transitioned to an individual contributor role as a
Senior Developer, and I began working remotely as a member of a Scrum team based
in Burlington, VT.\@ After working remotely for a year I decided to
relocate to Burlington, VT.\@ Moving had two benefits, the direct, in
person interaction was more fun and it led to more advancement opportunities.

I joined the Dealer.com's Incentives Scrum team to bring stability and leadership to the Scrum Team.
DDC's Incentives team collects Cash, APR, and Lease incentives from multiple sources,
links these incentives with vehicles currently in inventory at our client dealerships,
and makes them available for display on dealerships' websites.
