\begin{cvparagraph}
I was hired by Cox Automotive, then called Dealer.com, as an
Engineering Manager, one of two in their Manhattan Beach, CA office.
I managed engineers who were parts of 2 scrum teams, a total of 7
individuals.
\end{cvparagraph}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Prior to becoming an Engineering Manager in my career, I had been a
software engineer, and after becoming an Engineering Manager, I kept my
hands in the code, usually by intercepting one-off requests that
risked derailing my teams' planned efforts.\@ In late 2016, Cox
Automotive decided to end its engineering presence in Manhattan
Beach.\@ At that point, I transitioned to an individual contributor role as a
Senior Developer, and I began working remotely as part of a Scrum team based
in Burlington, VT.\@ After working remotely for a year I chose to
relocate to Burlington, VT hoping to improve advancement opportunities.

\begin{cvparagraph}
I joined this newly forming scrum team focused on a new reporting tool, Command Center.
Its goal is to bring together Reporting and Analytics for a broad array of Cox products.
Currently each product sold by Cox Automotive includes its own data analytics and reporting systems.
Initially Command Center will be a jumping off point to the scattered reporting sub-systems, and slowly
take over reporting directly from within Command Center for more and more use cases.

I joined the scrum team focused on Vehicle Incentives to bring it stability and leadership.
Dealer.com's (DDC) incentives team collects Cash, APR, and Lease incentives from multiple sources,
links them with the vehicles currently in inventory at our clients' dealerships,
and makes them available for display on the dealerships' DDC websites.
