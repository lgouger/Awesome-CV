\begin{cvparagraph}
I'm seeking a role as a Lead Software Engineer.  My career includes
time as a Senior Developer and as an Engineering Manager. I've reached
the conclusion that I enjoy the former more.  I enjoy having my hands
in the architecture, design, coding, testing, deploying, monitoring,
and overall ownership of a software system.  I understand that there's
more to developing reliable, scalable, maintainable, and performant
software systems than simply writing the code.  I enjoy the team
building process and helping mentor all team members as they grow and
develop.
